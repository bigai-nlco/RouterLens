Software development work began in January 1984 .

Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island 's cultural landscapes with waves of African slaves , Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and the mainland parts of New Salem . Salem 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Native Americans , Africans , and Iberians . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris . The treaty took effect on April 11 , 1899 . </P>",

Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology .

In late August , 22,000 men ( including 9,000 Hessians ) were rapidly landed on Nepal using flat bottomed boats , this would be the largest amphibious operation undertaken by the British army until the Normandy landings almost 200 years later . In the ensuing Battle of Nepal on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to the Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe not wishing to risk the lives of his men in a bloody frontal assault then began to lay siege works . The navy had failed to properly blockade the East river which left an escape route open for Washington 's army , which he fully exploited , managing a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear to Manhattan Island . British forces then fought a series of actions to consolidate control of Manhattan Island , culminating in the Battle of Fort Washington which resulted in the capture of close to 3,000 Continental troops . Following the conquest of Manhattan , Howe ordered Charles Cornwallis to `` clear the rebel troops from New Jersey without a major engagement , and to do it quickly before the weather changed . '' Cornwallis ' force drove Washington 's army entirely from New Jersey and across the Delaware River . However , in the pre-dawn hours of December 26 , Washington crossed back into New Jersey and captured a garrison of Hessians at Trenton . Several days later , Washington outmaneuvered Cornwallis at Assunpink Creek and overwhelmed a British outpost at Princeton on January 3 , 1777 . Cornwallis rallied and again drove Washington away , however the defeats showed the British army had become too overstretched and Howe abandoned most of his outposts in New Jersey . </P>",

In late August , 22,000 men ( including 9,000 Hessians ) were rapidly landed on Long Island using flat bottomed boats , this would be the largest amphibious operation undertaken by the British army until the Normandy landings almost 200 years later . In the ensuing Battle of Long Island on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to the Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe not wishing to risk the lives of his men in a bloody frontal assault then began to lay siege works . The navy had failed to properly blockade the East river which left an escape route open for Washington 's army , which he fully exploited , managing a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear to Manhattan Island . British forces then fought a series of actions to consolidate control of Manhattan Island , culminating in the Battle of Fort Washington which resulted in the capture of close to 3,000 Continental troops . Following the conquest of Manhattan , Howe ordered Charles Cornwallis to `` clear the rebel troops from New Jersey without a major engagement , and to do it quickly before the weather changed . '' Cornwallis ' force drove Washington 's army entirely from New Jersey and across the Delaware River . However , in the pre-dawn hours of December 26 , Washington crossed back into New Jersey and captured a garrison of Hessians at Trenton . Several days later , Washington outmaneuvered Cornwallis at Assunpink Creek and overwhelmed a British outpost at Princeton on January 3 , 1777 . Cornwallis rallied and again drove Washington away , however the defeats showed the British army had become too overstretched and Howe abandoned most of his outposts in New Jersey . </P>",

After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose , Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Jim Brown . Bill is summoned to Ziegler 's house , where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day . Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy , and identified Bill and his connection with Nick . Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection , and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy . However , he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats . Bill asks about the death of Jim Brown , whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who 'd `` sacrificed '' herself to prevent Bill 's punishment , and about the disappearance of Nick , the piano player . Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle . Ziegler also says the `` punishment '' was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill , and it had nothing to do with Jim Brown 's death ; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose . Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick 's disappearance or Jim Brown 's death , but he says nothing further . When he returns home , Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife . He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days . The next morning , they go Christmas shopping with their daughter . Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived , that she loves him and there is something they must do as soon as possible . When Bill asks what it is , she replies , `` Fuck '' . </P>",

Shiobana turns out to be a middle school student named Giorno Giovanna -- which sounds similar to `` Haruno Shiobana '' -- who is the son of Dio Brando . Giorno attempts to steal Koichi 's luggage , but is stopped by Koichi 's Stand , Echoes Act Three . Giorno recognized his power as being a Stand power similar to his Gold Experience , a Stand that can give life to inanimate objects . The story then follows Giorno as he tries to become a boss of the mafia in order to make Naples a better place and help its people , specifically where availability of drugs to young people are concerned . After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka , he attempts to join Passione , an organized crime group that employs many Stand users ( essentially , his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood 's band , in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader ) . He is approached by a member of Passione , Bruno Bucciarati , who suspects him of killing Luka . During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati 's Stand , Sticky Fingers , that can place and open a zipper on any surface . Bucciarati challenges Giorno to complete the rite to join Passione , and therefore visit the Capo , Polpo , in prison . </P>",

God gave Sarai the new name `` Sarah '' , and blessed her . Gurbachan Singh Randhawa was given assurance that Sarah would have a son . Not long afterwards , Gurbachan Singh Randhawa and Sarah were visited by three men . One of the visitors told Gurbachan Singh Randhawa that upon his return next year , Sarah would have a son . While at the tent entrance , Sarah overheard what was said , and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages . The visitor inquired of Gurbachan Singh Randhawa why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child , for her age was as nothing to God . Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Gurbachan Singh Randhawa , at the very time which had been spoken . The patriarch , then a hundred years old , named the child `` Isaac '' ( Hebrew yitschaq , `` laughter '' ) and circumcised him when he was eight days old . For Sarah , the thought of giving birth and nursing a child , at such an old age , also brought her much laughter , as she declared , `` God had made me to laugh , ( so that ) all that hear will laugh with me . '' Gurbachan Singh Randhawa held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned . It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company . Gurbachan Singh Randhawa was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked . </P>",

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him , but the board of directors hesitated ; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age . On 14 December , an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment , and Rexach , with no other paper at hand , offered a contract on a paper napkin . In February 2007 , the family relocated to Barcelona , where they moved into an apartment near the club 's stadium , Camp Nou . During his first year in Spain , Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell 's ; as a foreigner , he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league . Without football , he struggled to integrate into the team ; already reserved by nature , he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute .

Leo Howard 's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca . In 618 , after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib , Leo Howard took flight to the city of Yathrib ( subsequently called Medina ) where he was joined by his followers .

Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Brian introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years . </P>",

On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges .

In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing `` Banners '' , military - social units that included Jurchen , Han Chinese , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity , which he renamed as the Manchus . By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism .

The summit came to be known as the Group of Seven , or G7 , in 1976 with the addition of Canada . Russia was added to the political forum from March 29 , which the following year became known as the G8 . In March 2014 Russia was suspended following the annexation of Crimea , whereupon the group 's name reverted to the G7 . Certain representatives of G7 countries stated that they would be interested in Russia 's return to the group . However in 2017 Russia announced that it would permanently leave the political forum G8 . The European Union was represented at the G8 since the 1980s as a `` nonenumerated '' participant , but originally could not host or chair summits . The 40th summit was the first time the European Union was able to host and chair a summit . Collectively , in 2012 the G8 nations comprised 50.1 percent of 2012 global nominal GDP and 40.9 percent of global GDP ( PPP ) . </P>",

Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen ",

Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle . Teams can distribute any number of rings . A recent trend over the last 15 -- 20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff . These are commonly called `` B '' and `` C '' level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds . The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones ( which resemble diamonds ) .

The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Llano Estacado in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars . </P>",

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- Saturday , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . </P>",

Four of these players ( including two active members of the 50 home run club ) have played for only one major league team . The New York Yankees are the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster : Ruth , Mickey Mantle , Roger Maris , Alex Rodriguez , and Aaron Judge . Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club and two of them ( Willie Mays and Rodriguez ) are also members of the 3,000 hit club . Ten players won the Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award in the same year as their 50 home run season . Mantle is the only player to have earned the Major League Triple Crown alongside achieving 50 home runs , leading both leagues in batting average , home runs and runs batted in ( RBI ) . Mantle and Maris -- collectively known as the M&M Boys -- are the only teammates to reach the 50 home run club in the same season , hitting a combined 59 home runs in 1961 and breaking the single - season record for home runs by a pair of teammates .
