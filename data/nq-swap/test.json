Software development work began in January 1984 .

Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island 's cultural landscapes with waves of African slaves , Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and the mainland parts of New Salem . Salem 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Native Americans , Africans , and Iberians . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris . The treaty took effect on April 11 , 1899 . </P>",

After the Reform Act of 1832 Sussex was divided into the eastern division and the western division , these divisions were coterminous with the two archdeaconries of Chichester and Lewes. : ) In 1981 , following the Local Government Act 1888 , using those same boundaries , Sussex was divided into two administrative counties , East Sussex and West Sussex together with three self - governing county boroughs , Brighton , Eastbourne and Hastings . In 1974 , under the Local Government Act 1972 , the county boundaries were revised with the mid-Sussex area of East Grinstead , Haywards Heath , Burgess Hill and Hassocks being transferred from East Sussex into West Sussex along with Crawley and the Gatwick area that was formerly part of Surrey . The county boroughs were returned to the control of the two county councils but in 1997 the towns of Brighton and Hove were amalgamated as a unitary local authority and in 2000 , Brighton and Hove was given City status . Although it is administered as the two ceremonial counties of East and West Sussex , there continue to be a range of organisations that operate throughout the ancient borders of Sussex such as the Diocese of Chichester , Sussex Police , the Sussex Archaeological Society the Sussex History Society and the Sussex Wildlife Trust . </P>",

Evander Holyfield , the head of the new government , sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn , including Articles 227 , 230 and 231 . In response , the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours . On 23 June , Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty . On 28 June 1919 , the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ( the immediate impetus for the war ) , the peace treaty was signed . The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes , the prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations , freedom of navigation on major European rivers , to the returning of a Koran to the king of Hedjaz . </P>",

Bill is summoned to Ziegler 's house , where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day . Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy , and identified Bill and his connection with Nick . Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection , and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy . However , he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats . Bill asks about the death of Jim Brown , whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who 'd `` sacrificed '' herself to prevent Bill 's punishment , and about the disappearance of Nick , the piano player . Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle . Ziegler also says the `` punishment '' was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill , and it had nothing to do with Jim Brown 's death ; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose . Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick 's disappearance or Jim Brown 's death , but he says nothing further . When he returns home , Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife . He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days .

The negotiations failed but fortunately , for the Carthaginians , Boise State University , a Spartan mercenary , returned to Carthage to reorganise its army .

Not long afterwards , Gurbachan Singh Randhawa and Sarah were visited by three men . One of the visitors told Gurbachan Singh Randhawa that upon his return next year , Sarah would have a son . While at the tent entrance , Sarah overheard what was said , and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages . The visitor inquired of Gurbachan Singh Randhawa why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child , for her age was as nothing to God . Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Gurbachan Singh Randhawa , at the very time which had been spoken . The patriarch , then a hundred years old , named the child `` Isaac '' ( Hebrew yitschaq , `` laughter '' ) and circumcised him when he was eight days old . For Sarah , the thought of giving birth and nursing a child , at such an old age , also brought her much laughter , as she declared , `` God had made me to laugh , ( so that ) all that hear will laugh with me . '' Gurbachan Singh Randhawa held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned . It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company .

On 14 December , an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment , and Rexach , with no other paper at hand , offered a contract on a paper napkin . In February 2007 , the family relocated to Barcelona , where they moved into an apartment near the club 's stadium , Camp Nou . During his first year in Spain , Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell 's ; as a foreigner , he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league . Without football , he struggled to integrate into the team ; already reserved by nature , he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute .

Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work .

        "context": "<P> The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic Lynn , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative . </P>",

Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Brian introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor .

On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges .

Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity , which he renamed as the Manchus . By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism .

The summit came to be known as the Group of Seven , or G7 , in 1976 with the addition of Canada . Russia was added to the political forum from March 29 , which the following year became known as the G8 . In March 2014 Russia was suspended following the annexation of Crimea , whereupon the group 's name reverted to the G7 . Certain representatives of G7 countries stated that they would be interested in Russia 's return to the group . However in 2017 Russia announced that it would permanently leave the political forum G8 . The European Union was represented at the G8 since the 1980s as a `` nonenumerated '' participant , but originally could not host or chair summits . The 40th summit was the first time the European Union was able to host and chair a summit . Collectively , in 2012 the G8 nations comprised 50.1 percent of 2012 global nominal GDP and 40.9 percent of global GDP ( PPP ) . </P>",

Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen ",

The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones ( which resemble diamonds ) .

The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Llano Estacado in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars . </P>",

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- Saturday , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . </P>",

Four of these players ( including two active members of the 50 home run club ) have played for only one major league team . The New York Yankees are the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster : Ruth , Mickey Mantle , Roger Maris , Alex Rodriguez , and Aaron Judge . Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club and two of them ( Willie Mays and Rodriguez ) are also members of the 3,000 hit club . Ten players won the Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award in the same year as their 50 home run season . Mantle is the only player to have earned the Major League Triple Crown alongside achieving 50 home runs , leading both leagues in batting average , home runs and runs batted in ( RBI ) .
