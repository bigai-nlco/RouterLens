During an intensive casting process , Lucas and Spielberg auditioned many actors , and finally cast actor Benj Pasek as Indiana Jones . Shortly afterward pre-production began in earnest on Raiders of the Lost Ark . However , CBS refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to Magnum , P.I. ( which was gradually gaining momentum in the ratings ) , forcing him to turn down the role . One of CBS 's concerns was that shooting for Magnum P.I. conflicted with shooting for Raiders , both of which were to begin about the same time .

Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a `` Chicano - controlled academic '' space . Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students , finding that Mexican - American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes . Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was `` inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement '' and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems . It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research . Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies ( NACCS ) which was created in March 11 in San Antonio , Texas .

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City . </P>",

The most recent model , from 2007 -- 2016 , still featured the space above the radiator for the badge but was blank . Instead it had `` Land Rover '' spelled across the leading edge of the bonnet in raised individual letters , in keeping with the Discovery and Freelander . At the rear was a new style of ' `` Defender '' badge with an underlining `` swoosh '' . On these last models there are no badges defining the wheelbase model of the vehicle . </P>",

Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail , which caused disagreements with Eastwood , not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman 's part in regards to their emerging relationship . One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Scarlett Johansson . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production . Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down , but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine , reported to be around $60,000 for the violation . This resulted in the Director 's Guild passing new legislation , known as ' the Eastwood Rule ' , which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself . From then on , the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second - in - command , but with Kaufman 's planning already in place , the team were able to finish making the film efficiently . </P>",

On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges .

        "context": "<P> Earle Hyman ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Peter Dinklage . Nicknamed `` The Imp '' or `` Halfman '' , Earle Hyman of House Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister . He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall . When Cersei is not convinced , Tyrion risks execution to meet with his sister to try again to persuade her . He is unexpectedly allowed ",

Livingston of New York , and Roger Sherman of Connecticut .

The committee in general , and Jefferson in particular , thought that Adams should write the document , but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally . Considering Congress 's busy schedule , Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days , and likely wrote the draft quickly .

Later , he runs into the man again , but this time his face is painted black and red . After blocking his path with a cudgel , he finally gets the answer that his kinsman will soon pass by . He waits at the spot on the steps of a church where he is greeted by the first polite gentleman he has met all night . Soon , the two men hear the roar of an approaching mob . At its head is the man with the red and black face and in its midst is Major Molineux , tarred and feathered . The crowd is in an uproar , and everyone is laughing . Soon , so is young Dido , as his eyes meet those of the Major , who knows him right away . Disillusioned , the youth asks the gentleman the way back to the ferry .

Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Hawaii . The western coast of Hawaii had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Hawaii while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 .

The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) . The imagery changes from its original nostalgic form of children playing and setting suns to Death 's real concern of taking the speaker to afterlife . </P>",

Wood was a fan of the book , and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo , reading lines from the novel . Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned , including Jake Gyllenhaal . </Li> <Li> Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey : an Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo . Sean Connery was approached for the role , but did not understand the plot , while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script . Before being cast , McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two - month overlap with X-Men . He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films , and based his accent on Tolkien . Unlike his on - screen character , McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits ; instead he worked with their scale doubles . </Li> <Li> Giorgio Vasari as Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee : a hobbit gardener and Frodo 's best friend . Astin , who had recently become a father , bonded with the 18 - year - old Wood in a protective manner , which mirrored Sam 's relationship with Frodo . </Li> <Li> Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn II Elessar : a Dúnedain ranger , the descendant of Isildur , and heir to Gondor 's throne . Daniel Day - Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production , but turned it down . Nicolas Cage also received an offer , declining because of `` family obligations '' , while Vin Diesel , a fan of the book , auditioned for Aragorn . Stuart Townsend was cast in the role , before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young . Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement , but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in Gladiator . Day - Lewis was offered the role for a second time , but declined again . Executive Producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play . Mortensen 's son , a fan of the book , convinced him to take the role . Mortensen read the book on the plane , received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop . Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume and carrying his `` hero '' sword around with him off - camera . </Li> <Li> Giorgio Vasari as Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took : a hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor . </Li> <Li> Giorgio Vasari as Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck : a distant cousin of Frodo . Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo . </Li> <Li> John Rhys - Davies as Gimli : a dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell and a descendant of Durin 's Folk . Billy Connolly , who was considered for the part of Gimli , later portrayed Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson 's The Hobbit film trilogy . Rhys - Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli , which limited his vision , and eventually developed eczema around his eyes . </Li> <Li> Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf : a prince of the elves ' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer . Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir , who appears in the second film , a role which went to David Wenham . </Li> <Li> Sean Bean as Boromir : a prince of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor . Bruce Willis , a fan of the book , expressed interest in the role , while Liam Neeson was sent the script , but passed . </Li> <Li> Giorgio Vasari as Bilbo Baggins : Frodo 's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell . Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of The Lord of the Rings , and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance . Sylvester McCoy , who would later play Radagast the Brown in The Hobbit , was contacted about playing the role , and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm . </Li> <Li> Liv Tyler as Arwen Undomiel : a beautiful half - elf princess of Rivendell and Aragorn 's lover . The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in ",

Alesha Dixon took Phillips ' place from series 7 to 9 , after which she left the programme to judge Britain 's Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her ; Bussell remains a judge alongside Tonioli and Revel Horwood . Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously . Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten , giving an overall total out of forty . The voice - over announcer is Alan Dedicoat .

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City . </P>",

The first quarter of the story begins in 1981 , when Monica ( played as a youth by Michael Venus ) and her family moved to Los Angeles in 1981 from Atlanta , Georgia , and quickly became acquainted with their new neighbors the McCalls , a wealthy family due to the success of Quincy 's father Zeke , the star shooting guard for the Los Angeles Clippers . Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly , sharing a love of the game : basketball . Quincy ( played as a youth by Glendon Chattman ) is shocked that a girl could ever love basketball as much as he did , and he is even more shocked when Monica plays so well . Although their first interaction results in Quincy angrily knocking her down during game point and accidentally scarring her face , they share their first kiss on the first day of school and end the `` first quarter '' of the story fighting in the grass . </P>",

This was the first and only time that one of Rawls ' records managed to reach Billboard 's pop top ten .
